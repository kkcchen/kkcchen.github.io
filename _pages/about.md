## About Me

In machine learning, I’m driven by the question: *what is the best we can do with the data we have?*

I'm currently doing my undergraduate thesis on representation learning for human gut microbiomes. This is at the Vector Institute in Toronto, supervised by Prof. Rahul G. Krishnan and Prof. Michael Brudno.

Previously I've done research in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Alberta. I've also been a Software Engineering Intern at AMD.

I'm originally from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

I love teaching too! I'm a Teaching Assistant for two first-year Engineering courses at the University of Toronto:

- [ESC180: Introduction to Computer Programming](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/esc180h1)
- [MAT188: Linear Algebra](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/mat188h1) 


## Research Interests

Some interests that I've worked on:
- Representation Learning
- Robustness and Handling Distribution Shift
- AI for Science and Healthcare

Some interests I'd love to explore more:
- Bayesian Inference
- Statistical Machine Learning
- Causal and Mechanistic Representation Learning

## Outside of Research

In my free time, I **hike**, **snowboard**, and play **violin**.
